# CSCI4357-Apps
The apps I've made while taking CSCI4357 at University of Central Arkansas. Each app demonstrates basic Android development and Kotlin principals. 

List:
FlagQuiz : First App (Simple Single View International Flag Quiz)
app2 : Second App (AM/FM Radio App)
InternetTelevision : Third App (Multiview App for opening livestreams of digital television)
TheBeatles : Fourth App (App that navigates Beatles albums and searches YouTube. Doesn't function completely at this time due to disabled API for YouTube searches)
App5 : Fifth App (Target game)
App6 : Sixth App (Rock Paper Scissors game. Runnable but not completely functional)
